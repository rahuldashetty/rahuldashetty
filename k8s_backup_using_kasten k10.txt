To backup a kubernetes cluster with Kasten K10, you can follow these steps:

1.Install the Kasten K10 operator: To install Kasten K10 operator, you need to have the kubectl command-line tool and access to your k8s cluster. You can install the operator by running the following command:
     "kubectl apply -f https://docs.kasten.io/k10/latest/install/install-k10.yaml"

2.Create a Kasten K10 namespace: You can create a namespace for Kasten K10 by running the following command:
     "kubectl create namespace kasten-io"
     
3.Configure the Kasten K10 Backup: You can configure the backup by creating a Backup object using a YAML file. This YAML file will define the resources you want to back up, the schedule of the backup, and the storage location. You can create the YAML file and apply it to your cluster by running the following command:
     "kubectl apply -f <backup-config-yaml-file> -n kasten-io"
     
yaml code sample:
      apiVersion: kasten.io/v1
kind: Backup
metadata:
  name: web-app-backup
spec:
  schedule:
    cron: "0 0 * * *" # Daily at midnight
  targets:
  - apiVersion: v1
    kind: Pod
    name: web-app-pod
    namespace: default
  backupStrategy:
    backend: s3
    s3:
      accessKey: <access_key>
      secretKey: <secret_key>
      region: <region>
      bucket: <bucket_name>
      prefix: web-app-backup

4.Verify the Backup: To verify the backup, you can use the following command to check the status of the backup:
     "kubectl get backups -n kasten-io"

     
if you want you access gui of kasten to do that follow:

Connect to the cluster using the kubectl command-line tool.
Use the command kubectl get svc to list all the services running in the cluster.
Look for the service named "kasten-k10-web" or something similar.
Get the External IP address or LoadBalancer IP address of the service.
Access the Kasten K10 GUI by opening a web browser and navigating to the URL http://<External IP address>:<port> or http://<LoadBalancer IP address>:<port>

once you logged in you can take backup's and create policies in gui, but if you already took the backup you can get yaml file of the backup and using the yaml file you can create another cluster with same configuration, follow this steps:

Navigate to the Backup and Restore dashboard.

Select the backup you want to restore from the list of available backups.

Click on the “Restore” button and select the option “Download YAML”.

The restore YAML file will be downloaded to your local system. This YAML file contains the configuration required to restore the backup.

Use the kubectl command "kubectl apply -f <restore-config-yaml-file> -n kasten-io" to apply the YAML file and restore the backup.
